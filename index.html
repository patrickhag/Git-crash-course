        <h2><b>5 Reasons why I moved from Angular to React.</b></h2>
        <p>JANUARY 11, 2023 BY PATRICK HAG - <a href="this:void(0)" onmouseover="mouseIn(this)"
            onmouseleave="mouseOut(this)">EDIT THIS POST</a></p>
      </div>
      <p>I did a lot of Angular 1.x back in the days until I started to use React. I can say that I used both solutions
        extensively. But there were and are several reasons why I moved to React. These reasons were not clear from the
        beginning, but retrospectively I think I can summarize these very well.</p>
      <p>In the following I want to give you 10 reasons why I moved from Angular to React. I liked Angular in all its
        facets back in the days, but it was about time to move on. Perhaps the article helps people to understand the
        benefits of React, but also the benefits of Angular, to make a decision between Angular or React - or even React
        or Angular 2.</p>
      <p>The article is not intended to blame Angular. Angular, for myself, was a great single page app experience for a
        long time. I enjoyed the framework, because it gives you everything you need. I only used Angular 1.x
        extensively, so I cannot speak for Angular 2, but I think most of the philosophy behind the framework is still
        the same and adaptable for the article. In the end it is only my experience that I made with both solutions.</p>
      <p>The article is no comparison between two solutions per se. It is a reflection about why you could consider to
        use React as your solution. It makes no sense to compare apples and oranges. But it makes sense to reflect why
        you can use or why you have chosen a specific tool at hand.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, let's dive into the 10 reasons why I enjoy to use React now.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <h3 class="w3-center">REACT IS ONLY A VIEW LIBRARY</h3><br>
      <p>Single page applications (SPA) follow the common sense of component based user interfaces. A component gets an
        input and returns an instance of the component as output. For instance, the output can be a simple button
        element. You have to define your components with its input and ouput and internal behaviour only once.
        Afterwards you can use it everywhere in your DOM hierarchy to create instances of the component. In a best case
        scenario the defined component is easy to reuse and to compose into other components.</p>
      <p>React is an ideal fit for a component based user interface. It is only a view library and solves all the
        described component requirements. It is a library dedicated to solve one problem: It gives you all the tools to
        build effectively a component based user interface.
        <br><br>
        You can see React as one building block for your SPA. Once you need to solve other problems, you need other
        building blocks. Your application needs routing? Take a look at the routing solutions suited for React. Your
        application needs scaleable state management? Take a look at different state management solutions. You need to
        execute asynchronous requests? Take a look at one of the solutions like fetch, axios or superagent.
        <br><br>

        Nevertheless it is possible to build your application solely with React. It might be no mature application with
        routing and sophisticated state management, but it can work out for small applications. In The Road to learn
        React you can build one of these applications to learn plain React.
        <br><br>

        React itself is only a building block in your application. It offers you a solution to build component based
        user interfaces. Like every other building block it stays exchangeable. You can use another solution to build
        component based user interfaces but still can couple them with other building blocks.
        <br><br>

        In that perspective Angular is different. It isn't a library, but a framework. It offers you more than one
        building block. It is a more rigid solution. The ReactJs ecosystem, with all its building blocks, can be seen as
        a framework as well. But compared to AngularJs it offers exchangeable building blocks. In Angular you get
        everything out of the box. It is a paradox that on one hand it can be easier to learn it, because it is
        opinionated about its building blocks. But on the other hand you learn every building block at once which can be
        overwhelming. The latter applies for React too when you start to learn everything at once.
      </p>
      <br>
      <hr><br>
      <h2 class="w3-center">REACT IS AN INNOVATIVE PLACE.</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        React is only the core of the ecosystem and everything around it consists of building blocks. You are flexible
        to choose your building blocks to solve different problems. But it remains simple to exchange them. The
        simpleness to exchange them makes it possible for novel approaches to thrive. You can take Redux and MobX for
        state management as an example. Redux got great momentum in the early days yet MobX has a small community of
        advocates, because it is possible to exchange both solutions.
        <br><br>
        Even the core building block React is exchangeable. Recent libraries like Inferno and Preact compete with React
        and can be used to replace React. I cannot remember that someone used these libraries in another context. It
        makes no sense to use these approaches in Angular, because Angular comes with its own solutions.
        <br><br>
        The exchangeable building blocks in React make it possible to experiment with novel approaches. It gives these
        approaches room to get adopted by the community. It makes the React ecosystem such an innovative place.
      </p>
      <br>
      <hr><br>
      <h2 class="w3-center">JSX - MIX UP HTML AND JAVASCRIPT.</h2>
      <p>React comes with its own syntax to build components called JSX. In JSX you can mix up HTML and JavaScript.
        Additionally people often use inline styles in their elements. It is like adding CSS into the mix. It can be
        confusing in the beginning, but it feels natural eventually. You can use JavaScript to compose and manipulate
        your DOM, but it is inlined in your HTML. You can use built-in JavaScript functionalities like map and filter to
        display multiple (filtered) DOM nodes. But you can also use ternaries to make conditional renderings happen. You
        can use the full power of JavaScript in your HTML.
        <br>
        In the range of SPA solutions it was a novel approach to define your components with mixed up HTML and
        JavaScript. In older server side rendering solutions (e.g. JSP) that approach was already present.
        <br>
        In contrast, in Angular you have a clear separation of concerns between logic and view. There are built-in
        expressions like ng-repeat (Angular 1.x) or ngFor (Angular 2) in your HTML to accomplish the same thing like a
        native JavaScript map() in JSX.
      </p>

        <h4>ES6 class components</h4>

        </div>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>It is a good practice to use functional stateless components whenever you can. That means whenever you don't
        need access to the component state or lifecycle methods. It embraces a best practices around components where
        you keep them lightweight and small yet reusable, composable and functional without any side effects. By having
        such a small boilerplate you are encouraged to follow these best practices.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In conclusion I hope these reasons help you to have a better understanding of the React ecosystem. Maybe they
        help you to make a personal decision if you want to hop on the React train in 2023. Personally it helped me to
        reflect about my decision to start to learn React. Apart from that it was an upside that my company Small
        Improvements did this step as well in the mid of last year. But we have plenty of Angular leftovers and are keen
        to hire people who know both solutions.</p><br>
